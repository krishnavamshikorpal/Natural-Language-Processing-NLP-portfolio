    "**This model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers. For example, given the sentences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***\"John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too\".***\n",
    "\n",
    "***\"John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football\".***\n",
    "\n",
    "**The model outputs the vectors:***\n",

    "\n",
    "**[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]**\n",
    "\n",

    "### Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, they lose all information about word order: “John likes Mary” and “Mary likes John” correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag of n-grams models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data sparsity and high dimensionality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying words, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn’t always reflect the difference in meaning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "***The Word2Vec model addresses this second problem.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing: the Word2Vec Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "**word2vec is recent model that embeds words in a lower dimensional vector space using a shallow neural network.***\n",
    "\n",
    "**The result is a set of word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have differing meanings.**\n",
    "\n",
    "***For example, strong and powerful would be close together and strong and Paris would be relatively far.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### They are two versions of this model and Word2Vec class implements them both:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Skip-grams (SG)***\n",
    "\n",
    "***Continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW)***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skip-grams (SG):\n",
    "\n",
    "***The word2vec skip-grams model works for example, it take in pairs(word1, word2) generated by moving a window across the  text data*** \n",
    "\n",
    "***[Here window means parameter in word2vec algorithm. A typical window size might be 5, meaning 5 words behind and 5 words ahead (10 in total).]***\n",
    "\n",
    "***And trains a 1-hidden-layer neural network based on the synthetic task of given an input word, giving us a predicted probability distribution of nearby words to the input. A virtual one-hot encoding of words goes through a ‘projection layer’ to the hidden layer; these projection weights are later interpreted as the word embeddings. So if the hidden layer has 300 neurons, this network will give us 300-dimensional word embeddings.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***for deep intution about skip-gram visit this [site](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) ***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW):\n",
    "\n",
    "***Continuous-bag-of-words Word2vec is very similar to the skip-gram model. It is also a 1-hidden-layer neural network. The synthetic training task now uses the average of multiple input context words, rather than a single word as in skip-gram, to predict the center word. Again, the projection weights that turn one-hot words into averageable vectors, of the same width as the hidden layer, are interpreted as the word embeddings***\n"

       "'House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.'"
